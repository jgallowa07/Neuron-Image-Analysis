1. Is the program/scrip for labeling the images?
2. Shouldn't the datasets already be labled? how can we access that data?
3. Have you tried Mask R-CNN already? If so how did it go? Any tips other than continuing to read literature?
4. 


Need to read more into RetinaNet to have more questions about that.
